### Commit Naming Convention


* feat : for adding a new feature
* fix : for fixing a bug
* refactor : for changing code for peformance or convenience purpose (e.g. readibility)
* chore : for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc.)


After the category, there should be a ":" announcing the commit description.

### Statement(s)

After the colon, the commit description should consist in short statements describing the changes.

Each statement should **start with a verb** conjugated in an imperative way.
